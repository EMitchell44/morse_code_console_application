Note: This software has only been tested on Windows. The error handling is not exhaustive; it is possible to crash the program with bad inputs. Should the need arise, the settings can be manually reset to default by copying the contents of "default_settings.json" to "settings.json". The original files can be found at this program's github repository at: https://github.com/EMitchell44/morse_code_console_application
